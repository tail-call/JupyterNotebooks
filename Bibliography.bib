	abstract = {Categories of polymorphic lenses in computer science, and of open games in compositional game theory, have a curious structure that is reminiscent of compact closed categories, but differs in some crucial ways. Specifically they have a family of morphisms that behave like the counits of a compact closed category, but have no corresponding units; and they have a `partial' duality that behaves like transposition in a compact closed category when it is defined. We axiomatise this structure, which we refer to as a `teleological category'. We precisely define a diagrammatic language suitable for these categories, and prove a coherence theorem for them. This underpins the use of diagrammatic reasoning in compositional game theory, which has previously been used only informally.},

	abstract = {We introduce open games as a compositional foundation of economic game theory. A compositional approach potentially allows methods of game theory and theoretical computer science to be applied to large-scale economic models for which standard economic tools are not practical. An open game represents a game played relative to an arbitrary environment and to this end we introduce the concept of coutility, which is the utility generated by an open game and returned to its environment. Open games are the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category and can therefore be composed by categorical composition into sequential move games and by monoidal products into simultaneous move games. Open games can be represented by string diagrams which provide an intuitive but formal visualisation of the information flows. We show that a variety of games can be faithfully represented as open games in the sense of having the same Nash equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses.},

@phdthesis{towards-cgt,
	abstract = {We introduce a new foundation for game theory based on so-called open games. Unlike existing approaches open games are fully compositional: games are built using algebraic operations from standard components, such as players and outcome functions, with no fundamental distinction being made between the parts and the whole. Open games are intended to be applied at large scales where classical game theory becomes impractical to use, and this thesis therefore covers part of the theoretical foundation of a powerful new tool for economics and other subjects using game theory.
Formally we define a symmetric monoidal category whose morphisms are open games, which can therefore be combined either sequentially using categorical composition, or simultaneously using the monoidal product. Using this structure we can also graphically represent open games using string diagrams. We prove that the new definitions give the same results (both equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses) as classical game theory in several important special cases: normal form games with pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria, and perfect information games with subgame perfect equilibria.
This thesis also includes work on higher order game theory, a related but simpler approach to game theory that uses higher order functions to model players. This has been extensively developed by Martin Escard ́o and Paulo Oliva for games of perfect information, and we extend it to normal form games. We show that this approach can be used to elegantly model coordination and differentiation goals of players. We also argue that a modification of the solution concept used by Escard ́o and Oliva is more appropriate for such applications.},

@article{Fan_2024,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the stability of deep ReLU neural networks for nonparametric regression under the assumption that the noise has only a finite pth moment. We unveil how the optimal rate of convergence depends on p, the degree of smoothness and the intrinsic dimension in a class of nonparametric regression functions with hierarchical composition structure when both the adaptive Huber loss and deep ReLU neural networks are used. This optimal rate of convergence cannot be obtained by the ordinary least squares but can be achieved by the Huber loss with a properly chosen parameter that adapts to the sample size, smoothness, and moment parameters. A concentration inequality for the adaptive Huber ReLU neural network estimators with allowable optimization errors is also derived. To establish a matching lower bound within the class of neural network estimators using the Huber loss, we employ a different strategy from the traditional route: constructing a deep ReLU network estimator that has a better empirical loss than the true function and the difference between these two functions furnishes a low bound. This step is related to the Huberization bias, yet more critically to the approximability of deep ReLU networks. As a result, we also contribute some new results on the approximation theory of deep ReLU neural networks.},

	abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), leading to remarkable advancements in text understand- ing and generation. Nevertheless, alongside these strides, LLMs exhibit a critical tendency to produce hallucinations, resulting in content that is inconsistent with real-world facts or user inputs. This phenomenon poses substantial challenges to their practical deployment and raises concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios, which attracts increasing attention to detect and mitigate these hallucina- tions. In this survey, we aim to provide a thor- ough and in-depth overview of recent advances in the field of LLM hallucinations. We begin with an innovative taxonomy of LLM halluci- nations, then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive overview of hallucination de- tection methods and benchmarks. Additionally, representative approaches designed to mitigate hallucinations are introduced accordingly. Fi- nally, we analyze the challenges that highlight the current limitations and formulate open ques- tions, aiming to delineate pathways for future research on hallucinations in LLMs. },
