Of rice and roses, and Moses,
He, who encloses,
He knows this
Below this
Is what I don't
Right I don't might
I don't mind I don't
care I don't stop I don't
stare I don't flop there's a
day, there's a night, overture,
oversight, overdose, overdrive,
over seventy five
over twenty again
over Billie and Claire,
I believe I should say
That whatever I think
Is so bound to be
Where it
Must
Be
