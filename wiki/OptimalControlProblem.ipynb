    "# Optimal control problem\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal control problem is a type of mathematical optimization problem that involves finding a control law for a dynamical system over a period of time to minimize or maximize a certain performance criterion. The goal is to determine the best possible control inputs that will steer the system from an initial state to a desired final state while optimizing some objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of an Optimal Control Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Variables**: These are the variables that describe the state of the system at any given time. For example, in a mechanical system, the state variables might be position and velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Control Variables**: These are the inputs that can be adjusted to influence the state of the system. For example, in a car, the control variables might be the steering angle and the throttle position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamical System**: This is the set of differential equations that describe how the state variables evolve over time in response to the control inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Objective Function (Cost Function)**: This is the function that needs to be minimized or maximized. It typically represents some measure of performance, such as energy consumption, time, or error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Constraints**: These are the conditions that the state and control variables must satisfy, such as physical limitations or boundary conditions.\n"
